<h2 id="motivation"><a href="#header-2"></a>Motivation</h2>
<p>Sunbelt is an app that should make your life easier when it comes to organize appointments of a group an its members.</p>

<p>The most common method for organizing appointments is still by sending an e-mail to the group. But this has some trade offs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need someone who takes care of sending the mail to the group members.</li>
  <li>You need someone who takes care of evaluating the responses.</li>
  <li>Often you get a lot of unwanted emails when members reply to all.</li>
  <li>You can not see the a current feedback on an appointment.</li>
</ul>

<p>So this is, where the Sunbelt app is trying to make it easier and more comfortable for all group members.</p>
